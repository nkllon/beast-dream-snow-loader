## Important Notes

**Project Status:**
- MVP is complete and functional
- Beta pre-release (0.1.0b1) ready for PyPI
- A few more hours of work remaining (enhancements, not blockers)
- Core functionality is fully working
- Can be demonstrated immediately

**Timeline:**

- Rapid development with Beast framework
- Complete delivery (not just code, but tests, docs, deployment)
- Real-world integration (ServiceNow, UniFi)
- Open source contribution
- Professional quality (type safety, testing, documentation)

**What NOT to Say:**
- Don't say it's "almost done" - MVP is complete
- Don't minimize it - this is a substantial deliverable
- Don't apologize - this is impressive work
- Frame it as "just completed" not "working on"

## Example Phrasing

**For Resume:**
- "Just delivered complete MVP for UniFi → ServiceNow CMDB integration"
- "Developed using Beast framework patterns enabling rapid MVP completion"
- "Full-stack deliverable: code, tests, documentation, CI/CD automation"

**For Email:**
- "I just completed a project that's directly relevant to your role..."
- "I've been working on a ServiceNow integration project that demonstrates..."
- "This project showcases my ability to deliver complete solutions quickly..."
- "The repository is public and demonstrates the full development lifecycle..."

## Deliverables
